# BayesMultCircCovariates

This is the research archive for Mulder & Klugkist (2017), "Bayesian Estimation and Hypothesis Tests for a Circular GLM". 

This is the research archive only. If your interest is in applying the methods, please use the package [https://github.com/keesmulder/CircGLMBayes](`CircGLMBayes`) instead, as that package is much more user-friendly.

## Article JMP

The Sweave files for the published article. The published article can be generated by knitting the `.Rnw` file.  

## Code 

A variety of miscellaneous codes for exploring and describing circular data in general and the circular GLM model in particular. 

## Data

Code to generate data from the circular GLM model. 

## Simulation

R code to run the simulation studies described in the paper. The main script is `simulationStudyCircGLM.R`, which contains construction, print and plot methods for cGLMSim objects, which are result objects for the simulation study. 

## Simulation analysis

R code to analyze the simulation studies described in the paper. 

## Spread/Figures

Some R plotting codes for the plots from the paper.
